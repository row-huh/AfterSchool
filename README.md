To get started, use 
`git clone https://www.github.com/row-huh/pace.git`
in cmd. After doing this, you should have a local copy of the project

The file structure is divided between frontend, backend and vertex-ai folders so no one gets confused by too many files

As the project is built, the requirements.txt file (which is outside of all folders) will continue being updated, before running the project, make sure to 
`pip install -r requirements.txt` 
This would install all related libraries

For frontend, make sure you have installed node.js 
https://nodejs.org/en/learn/getting-started/how-to-install-nodejs

and after installing node.js, make sure to run 
`npm install react react-dom`
