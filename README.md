(readme is right now to guide team members);

To get started, use 
`git clone https://www.github.com/row-huh/pace.git`
in cmd. After doing this, you should have a local copy of the project

The file structure is divided between frontend, backend and vertex-ai folders so no one gets confused by too many files

As the project is built, the requirements.txt file (which is outside of all folders) will continue being updated, before running the project, make sure to 
`pip install -r requirements.txt` 
This would install all related libraries

For frontend, make sure you have installed node.js 
https://nodejs.org/en/learn/getting-started/how-to-install-nodejs

and after installing node.js, make sure to run 
`npm install react react-dom`

Make changes to the codebase and when done use
`git add .` to keep track of all the new files that may have been created, then
`git commit -am "<commit message that details what changes you made>"` to contribute your code, finally
`git push` - this pushes all the changes you made, all that you committed to the remote- which is this repository in github!
